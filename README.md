# BaedekAR

***BaedekAR*** is a “museum” app that uses ARKit’s 2D image recognition to draw AR titles over artwork it recognizes.

This app was the third of four apps that I presented for the ARKit Workshop at the [RWDevCon 2018 conference.](https://www.rwdevcon.com/) I built the app in front of the audience, who were invited to code along with me.
